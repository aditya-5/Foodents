Place the shrimp in serving dish (9x13 or 2 quart casserole) and toss gently with the olive oil, wine, 1 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Allow to sit at room temperature while you make the butter and garlic mixture.\r\n\r\nIn a small bowl, mash the softened butter with the garlic, shallots, parsley, rosemary, red pepper flakes, lemon zest, lemon juice, egg yolk, panko, 1\/2 teaspoon salt, and 1\/4 teaspoon of pepper until combined.\r\n\r\nSpread the butter mixture evenly over the shrimp. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until hot and bubbly. If you like the top browned, place under a broiler for 1-3 minutes (keep an eye on it). Serve with lemon wedges and French bread.\r\n\r\nNote: if using fresh shrimp, arrange for presentation. Starting from the outer edge of a 14-inch oval gratin dish, arrange the shrimp in a single layer cut side down with the tails curling up and towards the center of the dish. Pour the remaining marinade over the shrimp. ",
